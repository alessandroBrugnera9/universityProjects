## University programming projects
Coding projects done in **mechatronics engineering of Poli-USP** in different courses:

#### Control Engineering (focus on control Python and Matlab)
- Dynamic System (Matlab) 2019

#### Complex physical,algebraic numerical problems
- Numeric Calculus (Python) 2019,2021 and 2022
- Numeric Methods (Python and Matlab) 2020
- General Mechanics II (Matlab) 2020

#### Programming logic and science
- Mechatronics Programming (Python) 2018
- Embedded Systems (C, Python and GCode) 2020
- System Information (Python and Django) 2019


Numeric Calculus, Numeric Methods, Mechatronics Programming and General Mechanics II projects present mathematical, logical or physical problems that should be solved using efficient mathematical modelling and coding. These projects are bigger than the others and have specific requeriments detailed in the file "enunciado".

P.S.: The projects are written in portuguese, since they are projects for a brazilian University.
