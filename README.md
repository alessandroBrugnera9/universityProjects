## Universiry programming projects
Programming projects done in **mechatronics engineering of Poli-USP** in different courses:

#### Control Engineering (focus on control python and matlab)
- Control 1 (Python and Matlab)
- Control 2 (Python and Matlab)
- Dynamic System (Matlab)

#### Complex physical,algebraic numerical problems
- Numeric Calculus (Python)
- Numeric Methods (Python and Matlab)
- General Mechanics II (Matlab)

#### Programming logic and science
- Programming Introduction (Python)
- Mechatronics Programming (Python)
- Microcontrollers (C)
- Embedded System (C, Python and GCode)
- System Information (Python and Django)


Numeric Calculus, Numeric Methods, Programming Introduction and General Mechanics II projects are bigger and requires stricts functions to program simple and complex mathematical and algebraic problems.

P.S.: The projects are written in portuguese, since they are projects from a brazilian University.
